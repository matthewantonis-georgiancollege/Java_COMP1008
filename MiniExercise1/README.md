# Mini Exercise 1: 

## Process of the Program: 

### Task 1:
- Run the program in the terminal.
- The program asks the user to specify the number of elements they want to create.
- The user is then asked to input a numeric value for each element.
- The program will then convert this numeric value to one of the following types based on its value:
  - Boolean: if the value is 0 or 1
  - Byte: if the value is within Byte's min and max values (-128 to 127)
  - Short: if the value is within Short's min and max values (-32768 to 32767)
  - Integer: if the value is none of the above
- The program tells the user what the element will convert to.
- Finally, the output will be displayed in the terminal once all the elements are inputted.

### Task 2:
- The asks the user how many multiplication questions they want to answer.
- The program then generates a 10x10 multiplication table and asks the user randomly selected multiplication questions.
- The user's responses are checked for accuracy,
  - If the response is wrong, it will tell the user they were incorrect and what the correct answer is.
  - If the response is correct, it will tell the user they were correct. 
- Finally, the program summarizes their performance (number of correct answers and percentage score).
- The process will then finish and exit.
